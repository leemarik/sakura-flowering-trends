Here’s how you can fix the issue of ensuring you get accurate temperature data from the original dataset while improving your cleaning script. The key updates will:

Ensure temperature data is used directly without unnecessary clipping to a predefined range.
Use temperature_recon for missing avg_temperature values where available.
Retain temperature values as they appear in the original dataset for analysis integrity.

Key Fixes:
temperature_recon Handling: avg_temperature values are filled using temperature_recon if avg_temperature is missing.
No Clipping: Removed unnecessary clipping of avg_temperature to an arbitrary range (5–15°C).
Filter Critical Variables: Ensures no rows with missing avg_temperature or flowering_date remain.
Select Only Required Columns: The output retains only meaningful variables for downstream modeling and analysis.
Next Steps:
Verify that avg_temperature now reflects the original values, and NA values are addressed correctly.
Proceed with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to validate the dataset further.
Apply a linear regression model using avg_temperature as a predictor for day_of_year.

explain to me step by step which model would be the best for my project. My research goal is to assess the impact of temperature on sakura flowering dates over centuries and develop predictive models for future trends under different climate scenarios.

Choosing the best model for your project depends on your research goal: To assess the impact of temperature on sakura flowering dates over centuries and develop predictive models for future trends under different climate scenarios.

Step-by-Step Explanation of Model Options
1. Linear Regression
Use case: Simple relationships between variables (e.g., avg_temperature, year) and day_of_year.

Why consider it?

Easy to interpret.
Useful for estimating the impact of temperature (avg_temperature) and year (year) on flowering dates (day_of_year).
If the relationships are linear, this is a good baseline model.
Limitations:

Cannot handle non-linear relationships well (e.g., flowering dates might respond non-linearly to temperature).
Does not capture temporal trends (e.g., historical vs. modern data differences).
Recommendation: Start with linear regression as a baseline to assess if temperature and time have a significant linear relationship with flowering dates.

2. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
Use case: Non-linear relationships between variables and outcomes.

Why consider it?

Captures non-linear effects of temperature and time.
Flexible: uses smoothing functions (splines) to model the relationships between variables.
Can better model how flowering dates respond to temperature variations.
Limitations:

Less interpretable than linear regression.
More computationally intensive.
Recommendation: If exploratory analysis suggests non-linear relationships, GAMs are ideal. For instance, if flowering dates plateau after a certain temperature, GAMs can handle that non-linearity.

3. Time-Series Models (e.g., ARIMA, ETS)
Use case: Forecasting based on temporal trends.

Why consider it?

Models temporal patterns in the data, like trends or seasonality.
Suitable if your focus is purely on forecasting future flowering dates based on historical patterns.
Limitations:

Assumes past trends are consistent predictors of the future (might not account for unprecedented climate changes).
Requires evenly spaced time-series data; missing years can complicate the analysis.
Recommendation: If your goal is purely forecasting future flowering dates based on historical patterns, use a time-series model. However, this does not directly analyze the impact of temperature.

4. Hierarchical Bayesian Models
Use case: Accounting for uncertainty and differences between groups (e.g., historical vs. modern data).

Why consider it?

Quantifies uncertainty in predictions, which is crucial when working with historical and sparse data.
Allows for hierarchical modeling, e.g., by treating historical and modern data as separate groups while sharing information.
Ideal for combining data sources with varying reliability.
Limitations:

Computationally expensive and requires expertise in Bayesian modeling.
Interpretation can be challenging for beginners.
Recommendation: If you need to quantify uncertainty explicitly or combine data sources with different characteristics, Bayesian models are the best choice. Use this if you are comfortable with advanced modeling techniques and have time to learn.

5. Climate-Scenario Models (Using GAMs or Bayesian Models)
Use case: Predicting flowering dates under different climate scenarios.

Why consider it?

Combines the insights from linear regression or GAMs with future climate projections (e.g., IPCC temperature scenarios).
Can project flowering dates under hypothetical temperature trends.
Limitations:

Requires reliable future climate data.
Results depend heavily on assumptions about future temperature trends.
Recommendation: This approach aligns most closely with your research goal of assessing future trends. Use it in combination with GAMs or Bayesian models for the best results.

Final Recommendation for Your Project
Start with Linear Regression:

Build a simple model: day_of_year ~ avg_temperature + year.
Assess if temperature and year are significant predictors.
Use this as your baseline model for comparison.
Use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs):

Test for non-linear relationships. For example:
Does the effect of temperature on flowering dates plateau after a certain point?
Does the trend over time deviate from a straight line?
GAMs provide more flexibility to capture complex patterns.
Climate-Scenario Modeling (Future Focus):

Use GAMs or Bayesian models to predict flowering dates under IPCC climate scenarios.
Example:
How would a 2°C increase in average temperature shift flowering dates?
Use temperature projections for future years and your models to simulate flowering dates.
Optional: Hierarchical Bayesian Models:

If you want to quantify uncertainty and integrate historical and modern data rigorously.
Use this if your goal is to produce robust, probabilistic predictions.
Why GAMs with Climate Scenarios Might Be Best
Your project involves non-linear trends (temperature effects on flowering dates).
You want to predict future flowering dates under varying climate scenarios.
GAMs offer flexibility and can handle non-linear effects better than linear regression.
Would you like a complete GAM-based modeling script with future climate scenario projections?
