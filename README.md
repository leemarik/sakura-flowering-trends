-   `data/01raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Alex Cookson GitHub.
-   `data/02-analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `data/03-model_data` contains the parquet format saved test and train data.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains datasheet, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
